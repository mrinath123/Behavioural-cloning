# Behavioural-cloning

Before anything make anaconda environment using the above files.If you have gpu load env_gpu.
ALSO MAKE SURE YOU UPDATE ALL THE FILES IN THE ENVIRONMENT after loading.

You can see the model architectures I have used in the jupyter notebook file.
There is a h5 file of the nvidia's model.

You can find the custom model and the model using VGG16 by running the ipynb file( not including since a big file)

To run the model use the drive.py files but to run the nvidia's model use nvidia_drive.py.

You can record your run using video.py

The nividia's pretrained model has been used from
