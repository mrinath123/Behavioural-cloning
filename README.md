Before anything make anaconda environment using the above files.If you have gpu load env_gpu.
ALSO MAKE SURE YOU UPDATE ALL THE FILES IN THE ENVIRONMENT after loading.

You can see the model architectures I have used in the jupyter notebook file.
There are 3 h5 files one is my custom model, another using pretrained network( doesnt work properly)
and another is the nvidia's model.

To run the model use the drive.py files but to run the nvidia's model use nvidia_drive.py.

You can record your run using video.py
