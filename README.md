Before anything make anaconda environment using the above files.If you have gpu load env_gpu.
ALSO MAKE SURE YOU UPDATE ALL THE FILES IN THE ENVIRONMENT after loading.

You can see the model architectures I have used in the jupyter notebook file.
There are two h5 files one is my custom model and another is the nvidia's model.

We can find another model using VGG16 bu running the ipynb file( not including since a big file)

To run the model use the drive.py files but to run the nvidia's model use nvidia_drive.py.

You can record your run using video.py
